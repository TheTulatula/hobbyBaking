        Baking is a method of preparing food that uses dry heat, typically in an
        oven, but can also be done in hot ashes, or on hot stones. The most
        common baked item is bread, but many other types of foods can be baked.
        Heat is gradually transferred "from the surface of cakes, cookies, and
        pieces of bread to their center, typically conducted at elevated
        temperatures surpassing 150Â°C. Baking is a skill or way of cooking food
        in an oven. Sometimes, though, baking can also be done in hot ashes, or
        hot stones. It is used for making bread, cakes, pastries, pies, tarts,
        cookies, and much more. Such foods made by baking are called "baked
        goods". The ingredients used in baking include flour, water, leavening
        agents (baker's yeast, baking soda, baking powder), shortening (fats,
        oils), eggs, milk, and sugars. These are all mixed together to create
        dough or batter, which is then put into a pan or a sheet and heated.
        Leavening agents produce gas that becomes trapped in the dough. This
        makes it rise. Shortening makes doughs more easily workable and the
        bread that comes out in the end more soft and tender. Egg whites are
        used to help make a light, airy texture.
